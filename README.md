# Neon-District-Account-Creation

**Automation of Neon District account creation; outdated since the ReCaptcha was added.**

This is a pretty simple program, and didn't take me very long to write, but I figured I should upload it since I'm doing Neon District stuff anyway.



Requires SessionBox to be installed for Chrome, with hotkeys setup (specifically Control+Shift+A should create a new session in a new tab)

Requires 4 tabs to be open in a chrome window on the lefthand side of a 1440p screen in this order:

- generator.email
- passwordsgenerator.net
- random.org
- portal.neondistrict.io


and an Excel file on the righthand side.


I would put a more extensive README, but this is already outdated by the time I upload it.
